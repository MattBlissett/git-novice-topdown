You can do this part "for real", and only if you don't already have an organization GitHub account.

Go to https://github.com/organizations/new and choose carefully a name.  The GBIF Secretariat uses "gbif",
so our repositories are at https://github.com/gbif.

The ALA used "AtlasOfLivingAustralia", so theirs is at https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/.

Switch between the organizations by going to their separate pages.  From now on, when you create new
repositories, or fork existing ones, you must choose whether they're for your personal use, or your organization.

Use the "People" tab to add collaborators.

Public repositories are free.  GitHub charges for private (secret) repositories, but academic users are often
granted free usage -- you need to send a support request to GitHub to ask for this.
